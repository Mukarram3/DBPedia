            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Till now Wikipedia is available in 287 languages and have 3.8 million articles then map it with DBpedia
                Ontology that have 359 classes and 1,775 properties and make available on web. It has a great and active
                project dealing with structured data and Wikipedia. It presented data on the web deploying over Link
                data cloud and facilitated live web query services.
                <br>
                This is already created in 127 languages. Every
                country uses different techniques to developed DBpedia like some DBpedia â€˜s is following Greek DBpedia
                enhances the extraction framework. Wikipedia do not clearly define datatype of attributes. So, their
                problems were solved by using DBpedia mapping based extraction approach. So DBpedia ontology was
                developed and all attributes were mapped to the properties.
                <br>

                Wikidata provide a secondary and a tertiary
                database of structured data that everyone can edit. DBpedia is secure as compare to Wikipedia because in
                DBpedia only authorized person can edit the data. Wikipedia does not show specific data.it only show
                that data that are publicized. Facebook and Microsoft also take advantage of DBpedia. It has converted
                into a central knowledge base within Link Open Data. It has been interlinked with other knowledge bases
                like Geonames, EuroStat, the CIA World Facebook, Freebase and OpenCyc etc.
                In this project we provide the recipe of Urdu DBpedia.
                <br>
                It will be a contribution in DBpedia
                international community. It will facilitate those people whose native language is Urdu. As a new chapter
                it will be added to the multilingual DBpedia chapter, which can support the maintenance, extraction and
                enriching of DBpedia. It has the ability to answer enrich query. s system will also go through the
                maximum available resources and provide exact data and definition. Only authorized person will edit
                DBpedia contents and its contents will openly available for all users. DBpedia ontology is the
                structural backbone of DBpedia, in which mapping of Wikipedia Infoboxes structures to classes and
                properties will be done.
